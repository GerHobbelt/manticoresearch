# String functions

### CONCAT()
Concatenates two or more strings into one. Non-string arguments must be explicitly converted to string using `TO_STRING()` function

```sql
CONCAT(TO_STRING(float_attr), ',', TO_STRING(int_attr), ',', title)
```

### LEVENSHTEIN()
`LEVENSHTEIN ( pattern, source, {normalize=0, length_delta=0})` returns number (Levenshtein distance) of single-character edits (insertions, deletions or substitutions) between `pattern` and `source` strings required to make in `pattern` to make it `source`.

   * `pattern`, `source` - constant string, string field name, JSON field name or any expression which produces a string (like e.g. [SUBSTRING_INDEX()](../Functions/String_functions.md#SUBSTRING_INDEX%28%29))
   * `normalize` - option to get distance as a float number in the range of `[0.0 - 1.0]`, where 0.0 is the exact match and 1.0 is the maximum difference. Default value is 0, means to not normalize and provide the result as integer.
   * `length_delta` - to skip Levenshtein distance calculation and return `max(strlen(pattern), strlen(source))` in case the option is set and lengths of the strings differ more than by `length_delta` value. Default value is 0, means to calculate Levenshtein distance for any input strings. This option could be useful in case of checking mostly similar strings.

``` sql
SELECT LEVENSHTEIN('gily', attr1) AS dist, WEIGHT() AS w FROM test WHERE MATCH('test') ORDER BY w DESC, dist ASC;
SELECT LEVENSHTEIN('gily', j.name, {length_delta=6}) AS dist, WEIGHT() AS w FROM test WHERE MATCH('test') ORDER BY w DESC;
SELECT LEVENSHTEIN(title, j.name, {normalize=1}) AS dist, WEIGHT() AS w FROM test WHERE MATCH ('test') ORDER BY w DESC, dist ASC;
```

### REGEX()
`REGEX(attr,expr)` function returns 1 if regular expression matched to string of attribute and 0 otherwise. It works with both string and JSON attributes.

```sql
SELECT REGEX(content, 'box?') FROM test;
SELECT REGEX(j.color, 'red | pink') FROM test;
```

The expression should follow the RE2 syntax. For example, for case insensitive search you can do:
```sql
SELECT REGEX(content, '(?i)box') FROM test;
```

### SNIPPET()
`SNIPPET()` can be used to highlight search results in a given text. The first two arguments are: the text to highlight, and a query. It's possible to pass [options](../Searching/Highlighting.md#Highlighting-options) to the function as the third, fourth and so on arguments. `SNIPPET()` can fetch the text to use in highlighting from the table itself. The first argument in this case should be field name:

```sql         
SELECT SNIPPET(body, QUERY()) FROM myIndex WHERE MATCH('my.query')   
```

`QUERY()` expression in this example returns current fulltext query. `SNIPPET()` can also highlight non-indexed text:

```sql
mysql  SELECT id, SNIPPET('text to highlight', 'my.query', 'limit=100') FROM myIndex WHERE MATCH('my.query')
```

It can also be used to highlight the text fetched from other sources using an UDF:

```sql
SELECT id, SNIPPET(myUdf(id), 'my.query', 'limit=100') FROM myIndex WHERE MATCH('my.query')
```

where `myUdf()` would be a UDF that fetches a document by its ID from some external storage. `SNIPPET()` is a "post limit" function, meaning that computing snippets is postponed not just until the entire final result set is ready, but even after the `LIMIT` clause is applied. For example, with a `LIMIT 20,10` clause, `SNIPPET()` will be called at most 10 times.

Note, `SNIPPET()` doesn't support limiting by fields. Use [HIGHLIGHT()](../Searching/Highlighting.md#Highlighting-via-SQL) instead.

### SUBSTRING_INDEX()
`SUBSTRING_INDEX(string, delimiter, number)` returns a substring of a string before a specified number of delimiter occurs

   *   string - The original string. Can be a constant string or a string from a string/json attribute.
   *   delimiter - The delimiter to search for
   *   number - The number of times to search for the delimiter. Can be both a positive or negative number.If it is a positive number, this function will return all to the left of the delimiter. If it is a negative number, this function will return all to the right of the delimiter.

```sql
SELECT SUBSTRING_INDEX('www.w3schools.com', '.', 2) FROM test;
SELECT SUBSTRING_INDEX(j.coord, ' ', 1) FROM test;
```
