## Live index updates {#live-index-updates}

There are two major approaches to maintaining the full-text index contents up to date. Note, however, that both these approaches deal with the task of _full-text data updates_, and not attribute updates. Instant attribute updates are supported since version 0.9.8\. Refer to [UpdateAttributes()](../additional_functionality/updateattributes.md) API call description for details.

First, you can use disk-based indexes, partition them manually, and only rebuild the smaller partitions (so-called &quot;deltas&quot;) frequently. By minimizing the rebuild size, you can reduce the average indexing lag to something as low as 30-60 seconds. This approach was the only one available in versions 0.9.x. On huge collections it actually might be the most efficient one. Refer to [the section called “Delta index updates”](../delta_index_updates.md) for details.

Second, versions 1.x (starting with 1.10-beta) add support for so-called real-time indexes (RT indexes for short) that on-the-fly updates of the full-text data. Updates on a RT index can appear in the search results in 1-2 milliseconds, ie. 0.001-0.002 seconds. However, RT index are less efficient for bulk indexing huge amounts of data. Refer to [Chapter 4, _Real-time indexes_](../4_real-time_indexes/README.md) for details.
